# Security Policy

## Unsupported Security Policy

This project is a PEP (Personal Exercise Project) and does not come with any official support for security updates. As a result, there are no designated versions that are actively supported for security patches.

We acknowledge that security is essential, and users are encouraged to use this project for educational or personal purposes only. Given its nature as a PEP project, there are no guarantees of updates, including security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

While this project does not have a formal process for handling security vulnerabilities, responsible disclosure is appreciated. If you discover a vulnerability and would like to report it, you can do so by creating an issue in the project repository. I will do the best I can to address reported vulnerabilities, but please be aware that there may be no fixed timeline or guarantee of a response.

Users are recommended to use this project responsibly and at their own risk.
